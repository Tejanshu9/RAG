However, it's always good to ask the course organizers or administrators about joining a course, whether it's too late or not. Many courses offer flexible enrollment periods, while others may require you to sign up before a certain deadline. If you're referring to an online course, you might be able to register even if the course has already started, depending on the platform and the course policy.\n"
